## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 6, part 2

  This was one of my favorite labs because I coded something that actually made sense for use in real life. We made use of booleans a lot, which helped engrain it into my mind. It was one of the longer labs, but it was still fun and reminded me why I enjoy coding.

* Lab 9, part 2

  For this lab, even though it was rather short, I found the premise of this part quite funny. We used for statements to determine the validity of the two philosophers’ schedules. It’s cool because it’s based on an actual problem regarding multiple processes working at the same time.

* Lab 12, part 1

  Lab 12 and this part specifically was my favorite lab so far. I enjoyed how challenging it was and it’s fitting that this is the last lab in this class. We used a lot of the statements we learned this past semester, including for statements, if statements, booleans, as well as the RGB functionality from Magick++ to make a GIF. I liked this one so much because I could see the results of my work and it was very satisfying.
